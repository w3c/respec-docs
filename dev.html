      <p>
        ReSpec v3 is composed of many small and (mostly) simple plugins that perform one task
        (sometimes two) and do that well. You can think of it as a set of small Unix command-line
        utilities through which content is piped (except that in some cases they can operate
        asynchronously). Removing or adding plugins is trivial, and defining new ones is very
        simple. The only difficulty is that there are quite a few files and that you need to know
        where to look for what. This guide will explain the basic layout and architecture,
        introduce you to writing plugins, and tell you how to create your own ReSpec profile so as
        to be able to edit your own document types.

      <h2>Project Basics</h2>
      <p>
        The source for ReSpec can be found at <a
        href='https://github.com/darobin/respec/'>https://github.com/darobin/respec/</a>. That is
        also where issues and pull requests are made. More general discussion about ReSpec
        development takes place on <a href='mailto:spec-prod@w3.org'>spec-prod@w3.org</a> (<a
        href='http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/'>archives</a>, <a
        href='mailto:spec-prod-request@w3.org?Subject=subscribe'>subscribe</a>).

        <h2>How to contribute</h2>
        <p>
          ReSpec has a healthy and lively contributor base and we are happy for you to join the
          gang. You certainly are welcome to submit whatever change you wish to. Note however that
          if it is a complex feature or add substantial syntax to the language please try to
          coordinate with others first to avoid working long on something that will then be
          rejected).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're familiar with GitHub then contributing is simple: just fork and make pull
          requests. Please just be careful to note that the primary branch is <code>gh-pages</code>
          and not <code>master</code> (this ensures that the result gets published on the Web).
          <em>More importantly</em>, please note that the development branch is
          <code>develop</code>. If you are making patches and pull requests, please base them off
          this branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not familiar with GitHub, you need to follow the following steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Get a GitHub account. This is done quickly, and the GH people will not bother you at
            all. Plus, it's pretty much a requirement for the majority of OSS communities these
            days.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all you want to make is a small, simple change, you can use the Web interface.
            Navigate to the file that you want to change, click “Edit this file” in the toolbar,
            then save your changes — they will get sent to the project for approval (which ought to
            be quick).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you wish to make more complex changes, you will need to fork the project (click
            “Fork”), clone the resulting repository, make the changes there, and push it back. Then
            click the “Pull Request” button. This allows you to request that the project integrate
            your changes. Those should normally get processed relatively fast (depending on how
            complex they are).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have an existing fork, please make sure to synchronise it with the upstream
          repository before you make a pull request.

        <h2>Running the test suite</h2>
        <p>
          ReSpec runs a number of high level, end-to-end tests using <a
          href='http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/'>Jasmine</a>. These tests are run by <a
          href='https://travis-ci.org/darobin/respec'>Travis</a>, a hosted continuous integration
          solution, on each pull requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two options to run these tests locally: in a browser or using <a
          href='http://phantomjs.org/'>PhantomJS</a>.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>In a browser</h2>
          <p>
            The tests need to be served using a proper Web server, from the root of the repository
            to function properly. Any server will do. For instance, if you're one of those people
            who like Python, this will work:
          </p>
          <pre class='example highlight'>
            $ cd /path/to/repo/
            $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
            Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
          </pre>
          <p>
            Navigating to <code>http://localhost:8000/tests/SpecRunner.html</code> with any recent
            browser will launch the test suite.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>In PhantomJS</h2>
          <p>
            PhantomJS is a headless, WebKit-based browser. It allows running the tests directly from
            the command line.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to run the test from the command line, you need to <a
            href='http://nodejs.org/download/'>install Node</a>, <a
            href='https://npmjs.org/'>npm</a> and <a
            href='http://phantomjs.org/download.html'>PhantomJS</a>. <em>Note that npm comes bundled
            with recent versions of Node.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once these dependencies are installed, running the test suite should be as simple as:
          </p>
          <pre class='highlight'>$ npm test</pre>

      <h2>Building ReSpec</h2>
      <p>
        Normally, producing a build of ReSpec should not be necessary for anyone, unless you're on
        the core development team (and even then, mostly Robin does this). Certainly don't bother
        with this if you are providing pull requests. But on occasion it can be useful in order to
        debug a painful corner-case, so here are the instructions. This not being something normally
        exposed to the world, they are a bit convoluted (and may be simplified).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make sure you are up to date and on the develop branch (<code>git up; git checkout
          develop</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          You will need to have <a href='https://github.com/nvie/gitflow'>git flow</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get the current version (<code>grep version package.json</code>) and increment it in your
          head (or, you know, on a piece of paper).
        </li>
        <li>
          Start a new release in git flow using v$NEW_VERSION as the name, e.g. <code>git flow
          release start v3.1.61</code> if you are currently on 3.1.60.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update the version in <code>package.json</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the build script (<code>node tools/build-w3c-common.js</code>). This should respond
          "OK!" (if not, fix the issue).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the new build (<code>git add builds/respec-w3c-common-3.1.61.js</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Commit your changes (<code>git commit -am v3.1.61</code>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Finish the release git flow (<code>git flow release finish v3.1.61</code>). This should
          prompt you to enter a message for the tag.
        </li>
        <li>
          Push everything back to the server (<em>make sure you are pushing at least the develop and
          gh-pages branches</em>).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        That should be all. Normally, within a few minutes the W3C server will have picked up,
        gzipped, and published the latest and greatest version.

      <h2>Anatomy of a Plugin</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter we look at how a plugin is structured and how it ticks, how to handle its
        dependencies including to non-Javascript resources, how context and continuations work
        (including for asynchronous processing), what is available from the <code>utils</code>
        plugin, and some general information about how the templating language is used.

      <h2>Defining Your Own Profile</h2>
      <p>
        Creating your own profile is trivial: it can often consist of a very simple Javascript
        file, a little bit of CSS, and perhaps a straightforward HTML template. This chapter
        covers all of this, plus important information about plugin ordering and how to build and
        release your profile.
