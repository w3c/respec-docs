        ReSpec is a small, unobtrusive tool that makes writing specifications easier. Or at least,
        somewhat less painful. It cannot do anything to quell the barrage of disputatious feedback
        that you are being slammed with, nor can it find you implementers ever-so-slightly less
        hopelessly hapless at reading your brilliant prose. It has no means to fix the bizarre
        process fixations of your group's chair, and sadly it cannot replace <a
        href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119'>RFC 2119</a> with the more accurate <a
        href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919'>RFC 6919</a>. It will not stop those obstreperous
        people presently carrying pitchforks to your secret lair over that feature you pushed over
        to v2.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is <em>can</em> do however, is make the toil of writing a specification easier.
        Specifications tend to follow all manners of formalism, and in some cases will follow a
        strict set of conventions (e.g. W3C's "PubRules"). As an editor, you focus on actual
        features and correctness, ReSpec handle the likes of styling, referential integrity,
        bibliographical data, and a whole set of other dragons.
      </p>

      <h2>Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        The fundamental ideas that underlie ReSpec are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>It's Just HTML</dt>
        <dd>
          You just edit HTML, with some extra convention but nothing extra. All the decoration is
          performed by the script, informed by some very basic configuration. There is a simple 
          <a href='examples/template.html'>template</a> that you can use to get started.
        </dd>
        <dt>No Tool</dt>
        <dd>
          You never have to run a tool outside of your editor and browser. While the specification
          is being developed that's all that's needed. When a snapshot is needed for publication,
          all it takes is saving the generated DOM to a file (the script is very careful to cleanly
          remove itself and its dependencies so that you should normally get a document that's 
          immediately PubRules-OK). Moving from an <em>Edit-Run Tool-Browser</em> cycle to an
          <em>Edit-Browser</em> cycle can obviously be shown to make editors 33% more efficient.
        </dd>
        <dt><acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym></dt>
        <dd>
          Specifications often require repetitive structure (e.g. the header boilerplate, table of
          contents), repetitive markup (e.g. cross-linking to definitions, identifying conformance
          requirements), repeated information (e.g. an interface definition and its unfolded
          description), and many other things that make the process slow, painful, and
          error-prone. ReSpec makes every attempt to either generate that information for you
          based only on what varies from document to document, and to avoid repeating information
          inside of a document by reusing information automatically as much as possible.
        </dd>
        <dt>DWIM (Do What I Mean)</dt>
        <dd>
          There are many things in specifications that are somewhat obvious, but which you have to
          take care of anyway. RFC 2119 statements need to be marked up for instance, or
          references to definitions need linking. These are all handled for you trivially, so that
          you can focus on breaking the web and forget about the annoying details.
        </dd>
        <dt>(Almost) All In The Browser</dt>
        <dd>
          Typical technical writing tools will work in three steps: 1) make changes to the
          document, 2) run some arcane processing tool that will turn it into a format that can be
          displayed, 3) refresh the display to see if the change looks right — then rinse and
          repeat. ReSpec gets rid of the second step by making all the processing happen in the
          browser, which is also the tool you use for step 3. By skipping one stage out of three,
          it will make you 33% more efficient as an editor. The only case in which you will need
          to play with a processing tool is when you need to publish a snapshot of your
          specification as static HTML. This part is somewhat less trivial than the iterative use
          of ReSpec while editing, but it should be rare enough (typically once every few months)
          that it should pose no major issue.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        There are many good existing tools that can be used to produce W3C specifications. A
        non-exhaustive list includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/xmlspec/'>XMLSpec</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/postprocess'>CSS3 Module PostProcessor</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://anolis.gsnedders.com/'>Anolis</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/ReSpec/'>ReSpec</a> (Perl version)</li>
        <li>Many I forget...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But I was dissatisfied with all of them, including the one I wrote. The primary reason for
        that was that they all require one to run a tool in between editing and reloading the
        browser — an extra step that at the end of a long day's work editing is one step too many.
        Beyond that there are some smaller issues that I personally have with each, but it is
        largely a matter of taste.
      </p>

        The first version of ReSpec was shipped in August 2009. Since then, it has become the most
        popular tool for specification editing at W3C. It benefits from a lively community of
        users that provide support to one another and contribute patches regularly. Now at version
        3, it is a robust, full-featured tool surrounded by kind people.

        <em>Please</em> use that instead of emailing me (Robin) directly as the chances 
        are that questions or enhancement ideas will be shared by others. Thanks!

      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>
        The following organisations deserve thanks for their direct support of ReSpec.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expway, for giving me the leeway and time to work on the original Perl version of ReSpec
        over a decade ago. While that code has since been discontinued, it was nevertheless very
        helpful in establishing the principles that made the current version possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vodafone for being kind enough to support a huge part of the initial work on ReSpec v1.
        This project would not exist without their support for web standards, and for the creation
        of tools that make building open standards easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        The W3C for giving me the time to work on many refinements to ReSpec v3, notably this
        documentation which was put together during the W3C "Geek Week".
      </p>
      <p>
        The following people have contributed to the project: Tobie Langel, 
        Marcos Càceres, Greg Kellogg, Frederick Hirsch, Shane McCarron, Markus Lanthaler, Roy
        Fielding, Yves Lafon, Anssi Kostiainen, Cyril Concolato, Dominique Hazael-Massieux,
        Silvia Pfeiffer, Rich Tibbet, Dirk Schulze, Steven Speiche, Mounir Lamouri, Travis
        Leithead, Peter Linss, Mike Smith, Jacob Rossi, Chris Wilson, Bryan Sullivan, Adam
        Retter, Max Froumentin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stole a fair bit from Bert Bos and Geoffrey Sneddon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many deep thanks to all! If I've forgotten you, holler; it's an oversight due to the sorry
        overall state of my brain.
