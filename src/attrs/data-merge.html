  <h2>data-merge</h2>
  <p>
    This is a list of white space separated WebIDL identifiers that you wish to have merged into
    the current WebIDL section, so as to have them all described together rather than as separate
    sections. This is typically used to bring the definition for one or more dictionaries into the
    same section as an interface.
