        The primary use case for ReSpec is writing W3C specifications and this
        is what this guide covers. It can indeed be used for other document
        types (this documentation is itself written using a different ReSpec
        profile) but if that is your situation either of two cases apply: 1)
        you're using an existing profile that someone wrote, if so please
        consult the documentation for that profile; or 2) you're developing
        your own profile in which case you will want to read the <a href=
        'dev.html'>Developer's Guide</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User's Guide is organized in such a way that a complete newcomer
        may read it linearly and understand everything. That being said, read
        it in whatever order you think makes most sense to you, there are only
        limited references spanning sections.

      <h2>
        Basic Layout
      </h2>
      <p>
        A ReSpec document is a straightforward HTML document that brings in the
        ReSpec script, defines a few configuration variables, and follows a few
        conventions. The simplest way to see it at work is to look at an
        example — and don't worry if everything isn't immediately clear.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" data-include='examples/minimal-w3c.html'
      data-include-format='text'></pre>
      <p>
        Before anything else, you may wish to see <a href=
        'examples/minimal-w3c.html'>this example in action</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is essentially the smallest W3C specification you can write using
        ReSpec (in practice, you could eliminate a few things but then you
        would have a truly useless document). Some of the configuration may
        seem cryptic, but it is there because all W3C documents must have some
        specific information available — all will be explained soon.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>
          The Very Basics
        </h2>
        <p>
          As you can see, the document that is rendered in your browser is
          quite different from the one which is authored here. Yet they are the
          same document, with a sprinkle of ReSpec on top. Using your browser's
          developer tools, you may wish to take a look at the real DOM that is
          being produced and compare it with the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some basic things can be seen above. First, as you can see from the
          <code>DOCTYPE</code> and the <code>section</code> elements, ReSpec
          documents are built on HTML. This does not imply that you need to
          know the ins and outs of HTML — just a few simple bits will suffice.
          It also does not imply that the resulting document that you will
          produce at the end will be HTML (you can output a limited set of
          other formats).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the <code>title</code> of the document is reused as the
          title of the specification in the resulting document's
          <code>h1</code>. It's a small win, but that's always something less
          to repeat.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Including ReSpec
        </h2>
        <p>
          You can see that the example above includes a script sourced at
          <code>https://www.w3.org/Tools/respec/respec-w3c-common</code>. That
          is the ReSpec profile for W3C specifications. If you look at examples
          in the wild you may on occasion find other links — but use this one.
          You may also be tempted to save the script to your local directory
          and use it from there. That may on occasion be useful (e.g., if
          you're on a flight and your cache is busted) but strongly recommend
          that you link to the canonical URL provided above. The code is
          regularly updated and this will allow you to benefit from bug fixes
          and enhancements without even having to think about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may be wondering what that <code>class='remove'</code> is doing
          in there. We'll get to that later, but be sure to keep it on those
          <code>script</code> elements.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Specifying Configuration
        </h2>
        <p>
          In the example you can see a <code>script</code> element defining a
          <code>respecConfig</code> variable. Astute as you are, you've guessed
          that this is the ReSpec configuration. There are many things that can
          be done there, but we won't get into the details right now, but
          rather explore it piece by piece as needed. No doubt you can guess
          what some of those fields do.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing to remember though is this: that is how configuration is
          specified in ReSpec. Whenever you will see an indication that you can
          set a configuration option to a given value, it will be by modifying
          this object, simply adding, removing, or changing one of its fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also note that this is just a simple JavaScript variable; there is
          nothing magical about the way in which it is declared (it just needs
          to be fully defined when the load event triggers). If for instance
          you are working on a family of specifications that share some
          information (e.g., working group, editors) you can specify those in a
          common file which you load, and then add the document-specific
          fields.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Sections
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sections in ReSpec specifications are specified using HTML's
          <code>section</code> element. These can be nested, and the first
          <code>h*</code> child element is taken to be the section's title. You
          do not need to worry about nesting depth: ReSpec will take any
          element in the <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> range and renumber it
          to match the section's nesting depth correctly. It is a common
          convention (though by no means a requirement) to use <code>h2</code>
          for all sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "abstract" and "sotd" sections in the example specification are
          special (and required). We will get to those in the next chapter. For
          the time being, just accept them as part of the basic specification
          template.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last section in the specification is a regular section — it is
          simply there in order for there to be a little bit of content. There
          is no requirement to start a document with an introduction, though of
          course that's not necessarily a bad idea.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Language
        </h2>
        <p>
          W3C specifications are assumed to be in English. As a result, if you
          don't specify a <code>lang</code> attribute on your root element,
          ReSpec will add <code>lang='en'</code> as well as
          <code>dir='ltr'</code>. This does not prevent you from using other
          languages though: simply specify your own <code>lang</code> (in which
          case you may wish to also specify your own <code>dir</code> for good
          measure).

      <h2>
        Essential W3C Boilerplate
      </h2>
      <p>
        W3C boilerplate is extremely repetitive, but beneath the tedium is a
        wealth of options and subtle variations that are precisely what makes
        crafting the boilerplate by hand so hard to get right. This covers
        options for specification maturity, publication dates, alternatives
        (editor's drafts, other versions, other formats...), legalese variants,
        the various W3C specification URLs, the people writing it, information
        about the working group, and core sections such as Abstract, Status of
        this Document, and Conformance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will start by using an example of a basic specification very similar
        to the one used in the previous section.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" data-include='examples/boilerplate.html'
      data-include-format='text'></pre>
      <p>
        You can <a href='examples/boilerplate.html'>see the result in
        action</a>.
      </p>
      <p class='note'>
        There's a nifty trick that you will likely want to keep in your
        toolbox: many of ReSpec's configuration options can be specified in the
        query string (separated by semicolons) and they override the options
        specified in the source. We will use it a lot in this documentation so
        as to avoid having to generate examples for each small change that is
        possible (there are quite a few). So if I want to test the
        <a>subtitle</a> option without generating a copy of the same example
        with just that option changed, instead of accessing
        <code>examples/boilerplate.html</code> I can simply go to
        <code>examples/boilerplate.html?subtitle=This%20is%20a%20subtitle</code>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Title, Subtitle, Short Name
        </h2>
        <p>
          As noted in the previous chapter, the <code>title</code> of the
          document is reused as the title of the specification in the resulting
          document's <code>h1</code>. That way, they are always in sync and you
          need not worry about specifying it twice. Including a title is
          required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optionally, you can also specify a subtitle. The <a>subtitle</a>
          configuration option takes a simple string that will be used as a
          subtitle for the specification, right under the title. You can
          <a href=
          'examples/boilerplate.html?subtitle=Breaking%20the%20web%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom'>
          look at an example</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifications typically require having a "short name", which is the
          name used (amongst other places) in the canonical
          "http://w3.org/TR/short-name/" URLs. This is specified using the
          <a>shortName</a> option, as seen in the example above. <a href=
          'examples/boilerplate.html?shortName=something-else'>Look at an
          example</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Working Group Information
        </h2>
        <p>
          Most (but not all) W3C documents are produced by groups of some sort:
          Working Groups (WG), Interest Groups (IG), Incubator Groups (XG, now
          defunct), Coordination Groups, the TAG, and Community or Business
          Groups (CG, BG). For simplicity, we will be referring to all of the
          above as "Working Groups", since one should not be required to
          understand the many subtleties of the W3C Process in order to write a
          good specification. Configuration options that are prefixed with
          <code>wg</code> work equally well for all group types.
        </p>
        <p>
          When these groups release a document, they must include some
          information that is relevant and specific to them — all of this
          information is required. Documents produced in other situations
          (e.g., Submissions, unofficial drafts, etc.) don't require these
          options.
        </p>
        <div data-include='src/conf/wg.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'></div>
        <div data-include='src/conf/wgURI.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'>

        <div data-include='src/conf/wgPatentURI.html' data-oninclude=
        'mungeConf'></div>
        <p>
          The result of changing these configuration options can be seen in the
          "Status of this Document" section. Here is <a href=
          'examples/boilerplate.html?wg=Supercool%20Incubator%20Group;wgURI=http://berjon.com/;wgPublicList=public-supercool-xg;wgPatentURI=http://berjon.com/'>
          an example with different values</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incubator Groups require some additional information in addition to
          the above, but since this group type no longer exists they are
          deprecated: <a href=
          'ref.html#xgrGroupShortName'>xgrGroupShortName</a>, <a href=

        <h2>
          Specification Status
        </h2>
        <p>
          At any given time a specification must be in a given status. The
          <a>specStatus</a> option indicates which status that is. Typically, a
          status has implications in terms of what other options may be
          required. For instance, a document that is intended to become a
          Recommendation eventually and that is not the First Public Working
          Draft (FPWD) of that specification will require
          <a>previousPublishDate</a> and <a>previousMaturity</a> to be
          specified. The following table lists the values currently understood.
          Each of them has an example link demonstrating what it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The values for this configuration are rich and complex, and so are
          detailed in the <a href='ref.html#specStatus'>reference section for
          specStatus</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Extra links at top of the document
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are times when you might need extra links or other important
          information to appear together with other links at the top of the
          document. For example, you might want to have a link to the commit
          history for the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          ReSpec supports adding additional links by specifying an
          <code>otherLinks</code> property in the configuration. The values for
          this configuration option are rich and complex, so are detailed in
          the <a href="ref.html#otherLinks">reference section for
          otherLinks</a>.

        <h2>
          Extra Styling
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you wish to add your own additional styles to your document, just
          use the regular <code>link</code> and <code>style</code> elements. Be
          warned however that the W3C styles will <em>always</em> be added
          after yours, so if you wish to override them you will need to use
          more specific selectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some old documents, you will on occasion find an <a>extraCSS</a>
          configuration option. Do not use it, it is deprecated.

        <p>
          The process of publishing specifications typically involves releasing
          multiple versions in a row that have specific dates (so that people
          can see the evolution, and also for IP reasons). Additionally, some
          specification statuses involve delimited review periods. These are
          all specified using date-related options.
        </p>
        <p>
          The format used for all dates is <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.

        <h2>
          Editors & Authors
        </h2>
        <p>
          Every specification must have some <a>editors</a> (at least one) and

        <div data-include='src/conf/editors.html' data-oninclude='mungeConf'>

        <p>
          Editors are the people in charge of the document. Authors are people
          who produced substantial contributions, but did not manage the
          document per se. Most of the time authors are not specified, but that
          practice varies between groups (it was more common in XGs for
          instance, or sometimes in order to get academic credit the whole
          group is mentioned). Here is an example of specifying two editors and
          one author (with the surrounding document clipped for readability):

          Most groups maintain some form of version control system which is
          exposed over the web so that people can keep track of what edits are
          being made to a specification in between official releases. It is
          often useful to point to such documents, including from released
          specifications, so that people wishing to report issues can make sure
          that they aren't already fixed, and in general get the very latest
          version. In fact, EDs are often considered to be the most useful
          reference to have to a group's work. Two options control this.

          A specification does not always travel alone. In some cases, there
          can be an accompanying <a>errata</a> document, which you can specify
          by providing a URL for it (<a href=
          'examples/boilerplate.html?specStatus=REC;errata=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/erratum'>example</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, some groups occasionally find it desirable to produce
          alternative formats in which people may read the specification. For
          instance, to access it on an ebook reader you may produce an ePub
          alternative, or if your specification is intended to be read by
          printing devices you might use PDF. The <a>alternateFormats</a>
          option is set to an array of objects, each of which has two required
          fields: <code>uri</code>, for the link to the alternate document, and
          <code>label</code>, for a human readable string that matches it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your specification has a test suite (it does, right?), then you
          can point to it using <a>testSuiteURI</a>. And when your tests have
          successfully passed in enough implementations, you will want to
          document that in an implementation report which you can link to using
          <a>implementationReportURI</a>.

          By default, W3C specifications all get the regular W3C copyright

          that.

          Note & Recommendation Tracks
        </h2>
        <p>
          If you are working on a new version of an existing Recommendation,
          then it is required that your document point to that previous
          version. This is done using the <a>prevRecShortname</a> and
          <a>prevRecURI</a> options, which respectively provide the
          <a>shortName</a> for the existing Recommendation (e.g., "SVG", as
          opposed to "SVG2") and its URI. You can <a href=
          'examples/boilerplate.html?prevRecShortname=dahuts-v0;prevRecURI=http://w3.org/TR/dahuts-v0/'>
          look at an example</a>. If <a>prevRecURI</a> is not specified but
          <a>prevRecShortname</a> is, the latter will be used to generate the
          former by prefixing "http://www.w3.org/TR/" to it. Note however that
          while in the overwhelming majority of cases this works, it is not
          recommended to use this approach since if the Recommendation is later
          Rescinded, the link will be stale. Instead, use the dated link to the
          Recommendation.

        <p>
          The process for the publication of Notes has been a source of
          confusion. When producing multiple drafts of a Note in succession,
          some groups have traditionally simply published them all as Notes one
          after the other, indicating in the abstract or SotD if they intend to
          work further on this document or if it is final. Since Notes are not
          normative and entail no IP concerns, they don't need an elaborate
          process and this process was perhaps not entirely bad. However,
          that's not how Notes are commonly handled nowadays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The currently recommended process for Notes is closer to that which
          is used for Recommendation Track documents, typically: FPWD -&gt; WD
          (<var>n</var> times) -&gt; LC -&gt; Note. Given that any group may
          decide at any time to release a Rec-Track document as a Note instead
          (often because it has been abandoned) this is Process-correct but it
          does involve jumping through hoops (notably for IP) that likely
          should not be needed. It has been explained to me several times why
          this switch took place, but I can never recall the justification. At
          any rate, if you are confused with the Note track process but wish to
          stick to it, you can do so by setting <a>noRecTrack</a> to
          <code>true</code>.

        Structure
      </h2>
      <p>
        This chapter covers all the aspects of a ReSpec document's structure
        that were not covered as part of the very basics. As usual, let's start
        with an example. It is fairly long as it needs a decent amount of
        content in order to exemplify some features, but it should nevertheless
        be easy to understand.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" data-include='examples/structure.html'
      data-include-format='text'></pre>
      <p>
        You can see <a href='examples/structure.html'>this example in
        action</a>.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Sections
        </h2>
        <p>
          Sections, subsections, appendices, and whatever other structural
          items are marked up in ReSpec using <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>
          elements. If you're concerned about using an HTML5 construct that
          won't degrade well to older browsers, don't worry: ReSpec also adds
          the HTML5 shim/shiv and styling that makes them work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first child element of a section is expected to be one of the
          <code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code> elements. Any old one will do, since
          whichever one you pick will be renamed to use the level that matches
          the depth at which your section is nested. As you can see, the
          example uses only <code>h2</code> elements, but that is not what
          appears in the output. Using <code>h2</code> everywhere is sort of a
          tacit convention, but if you prefer <code>h5</code> that'll work just
          the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections will be automatically numbered. If you wish a section to
          have a specific ID, then simply use an <code>id</code> attribute on
          it. If you don't, ReSpec will generate one for you based on the
          section title, and will ensure that it is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          ReSpec sections understand some specific classes. First is the
          <code><a>introductory</a></code> class. It is used (rarely) for
          preliminary content that sits at the beginning of the document and
          which is not expected to be linked to from the table of contents. The
          abstract, SotD, and ToC sections automatically fall into this
          category (you need not worry about flagging them as such); the
          example above adds an “Overview” section exemplifying the behaviour.
          If you <em>do</em> wish all the introductory sections to be present
          in the ToC, see <a>tocIntroductory</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then is the <code><a>informative</a></code> class. It is used for
          regular sections or appendices that are not meant to contain
          normative material. It will automatically preface its content with
          the well-know “This section is non-normative” paragraph. The
          “Introduction” section in the example shows how it works.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally is the <code><a>appendix</a></code> class. It marks a
          section as being an appendix, as can be seen appearing at the end of
          the example. One important thing to know about appendix sections is
          that all the sections that follow an appendix will also be marked as
          appendices.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to link to a section and have its number and title
          automatically appear as part of the link, then you can use an empty
          anchor pointing to that ID, as in <code>&lt;a
          href='#foo'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>. The “Overview” section contains an
          example of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          A table of contents is generated automatically and placed right after
          the SotD. If you have a deeply nested document structure and find
          that the ToC is either too long or too deep, you can use the
          <a>maxTocLevel</a> option to limit how deep it goes. In the example
          used above, there is no limit and indeed one section is numbered
          4.1.1.1.1.1 — rather deep. Setting <a>maxTocLevel</a> to other values
          will yield <a href='examples/structure.html?maxTocLevel=1'>different
          results</a> (<a href='examples/structure.html?maxTocLevel=2'>other
          example with maxTocLevel=2</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The more observant readers will have noted that ReSpec also inserts
          some strange-looking comments in the generated source, that look like
          <code>&lt;!-- OddPage --&gt;</code>. These are present so that
          <code>html2ps</code> knows how to paginate correctly. Perhaps not
          useful to most but helpful to those who rely on it for printing, and
          harmless.
        </p>
        <p>
          If for whatever reason you wish to have no table of contents, simply
          set <code><a>noTOC</a></code> to <code>true</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Figures
        </h2>
        <p>
          Figures are also supported natively, using the <code>figure</code>
          and <code>figcaption</code> elements, and exhibit some features
          similar to sections. They are automatically granted an ID, and the
          caption is remembered for use elsewhere, as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Table of Figures is not generated by default, but making it
          happen is straightforward: all you need to do is add a section with
          ID <code>tof</code> anywhere in the document. ReSpec will do its best
          to guess if it should be an appendix, introductory, or just a regular
          section. Because the list has no depth, there is no equivalent to
          <a>maxTocLevel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finally, automatic linking to figures works just as it does for
          sections, with <code>&lt;a href='#foo-figures'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>.
          All of the above is demonstrated in the example.

        <h2>
          Examples & Syntax Highlighting
        </h2>
        <p>
          Any <code>pre</code> or <code>aside</code> element that has the
          <code>example</code> class on it will get the additional example
          header and style. Content inside <code>pre</code> elements is syntax
          highlighted. The syntax highlighter does not need to be instructed
          about which language it is highlighting and will try to do a decent
          job of guessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can disable syntax highlighting on a <code>pre</code> element by
          adding a "nohighlight" class.

        <h2>
          Inclusions & Transformations
        </h2>
        <p>
          At times you need to include an external resource directly into your
          document. This may be because your specifications have additional
          boilerplate, or (like it's done in this very guide) because you want
          examples to be both inlined and accessed directly without having to
          make sure that they are always in sync.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inclusion of external content in ReSpec is done using the
          <code><a>data-include</a></code> attribute. It is expected to point
          to a resource, using its relative path from the including document.
          The content will get included as a child of the element on which the
          inclusion is performed (unless <a>data-include-replace</a> is used,
          in which case it replaces the element), replacing its existing
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The include filter runs recursively so that included content that
          contains <code><a>data-include</a></code> attributes will work (just
          be sure not to build a circular loop in there, ReSpec won't detect it
          if only because it doesn't mind if you're shooting yourself in the
          foot).
        </p>
        <p>
          By default the inclusion is asynchronous, which means that the
          included content may or may not be further processed by ReSpec after
          it gets added to the DOM (the result won't be deterministic and so is
          only useful if the content is <em>not</em> meant to be further
          processed). If you wish to ensure that ReSpec processing is applied
          to the content, use <code><a>data-include-sync</a></code>. Be warned
          that there is a steep performance penalty in doing so, since all
          ReSpec processing will effectively pause until the content has been
          fully fetched and inserted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the processing pipeline, inclusion happens right after everything
          to do with the document's headers, style, and transformations have
          happened, which means that all the processing to do with structure,
          inlines, WebIDL, and everything else is applied to the included
          content as if it had always been part of the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times however one does not wish included content to be processed
          as if it were intended to be ReSpec content. For instance, content
          containing HTML may be an example that should not be processed (the
          examples in this document are included that way). In such cases, you
          can specify <code><a>data-include-format</a>='text'</code>. This will
          include the content as if it were text, and therefore only process it
          as much as text is expected to be. The only recognised value is
          <code>text</code>, nominally you can always set it to
          <code>html</code> but that's the default value.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an important caveat to take into account with the
          <code>data-include</code> functionality. ReSpec is designed so as to
          make life easier on editors. Because of that, people who do not wish
          to run a local web server and simply want to edit and refresh the
          specification they're working on from their local drives, using a
          <code>file:</code> URI in the browser, are completely supported in
          doing so (this involves some trickery behind the scenes since it
          would normally make it impossible to load some of the content that
          ReSpec uses — but that's not something you should ever have to know).
          When using <code>data-include</code> however, this is no longer
          possible. You either have to serve your ReSpec content from a web
          server or the included content will get blocked by the same-origin
          policy (which applies to all things <code>file:</code>). There is,
          unfortunately, no easy way to work around this. Be sure to note
          however that if you're <em>not</em> using <code>data-include</code>,
          you <em>never</em> have to worry about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, at times, you may wish to perform a quick and dirty
          transformation of some of your content. If the transformation is one
          that is commonly used and could be of general usefulness outside your
          own specification, then the proper way of handling it is to add the
          functionality to ReSpec itself. However, in a pinch, this approach
          will work as well. The way in which it is done is that you include a
          globally available Javascript function that takes the ReSpec
          <code>utils</code> object as its first parameter and a string of the
          content to be transformed as its second; then returns the processed
          value. Then where you wish the transformation to apply, you place a
          <code><a>data-transform</a></code> attribute — it will then process
          the entire content. The value of <code><a>data-transform</a></code>
          is a white space separated list of JavaScript function names. They
          are applied left to right, as if they were a pipeline. Again, I would
          like to stress that, in general, that is not the recommended
          approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to transform content brought in with
          <code><a>data-include</a></code> irrespective of whether it is loaded
          synchronously or not, use <code><a>data-oninclude</a></code>. It
          behaves exactly like <code><a>data-transform</a></code> except that
          the function gets a third parameter indicating the relative URL from
          which the content was loaded

        Common Inline Processing
      </h2>
      <p>
        Many repetitive tasks happen at the level of inline text, and ReSpec
        helps with those as well. This chapter covers references, along with
        the <a href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>SpecRef database</a>,
        the handling of abbreviations and acronyms, automatic RFC 2119 keyword
        detection, <code>dfn</code> definitions, and easier in-document

          RFC 2119
        </h2>
        <p>
          A very common construct in specifications is to use keywords defined
          in RFC 2119 which indicate precisely, using commonly agreed
          conventions, what requirements are placed on an implementation with
          what degree of strength (e.g., MUST, SHOULD NOT). All you need to do
          as an author is to include an all-caps MUST in your source and it
          will automatically get marked up as such (with the accompanying style
          applied to it afterwards).

        <h2>
          Abbreviations & Acronyms
        </h2>
        <p>
          HTML supports functionality to mark abbreviations and acronyms (using
          <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code> respectively), using the
          <code>title</code> attribute to provide the expanded version. This is
          something that's nice to do once, but tedious to repeat every time
          that a given term is used. What ReSpec does is that it allows you to
          do it just once, and it will detect all other uses of the same in the
          text and will automatically mark them up in the same way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that ReSpec could not possibly care less about whether you think
          that <code>acronym</code> is a valid element or not; if you use it,
          it will process it.

          HTML also supports the notion that you can give a term's definition
          using the <code>dfn</code> element. While that is nice, it is even
          better to link back to the definition whenever a term is used, which
          in turn is tedious. While ReSpec could go through the entire text and
          link every occurrence of a defined term back to its definition, that
          would be a problematic approach since it would risk linking the same
          term used with a different meaning. What it does instead is that it
          allows you to use an <code>href</code>-less <code>a</code> element
          around a term when you use it, and it will manage the link on its own
          (e.g., <code>&lt;a&gt;term&lt;/a&gt;</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          On occasion that won't be enough since you may be using the term in
          plural or conjugated, or in some other variant that does not exactly
          match the <code>dfn</code>. If so, then you can use the
          <code>data-lt</code> attribute on the <code>a</code> element in order
          to indicate the exact term that you wish to have a link to (the
          mnemonic here being "link term"). Alternately, and more
          interestingly, you can specify a <code>data-lt</code> attribute on
          the associated <code>dfn</code> element with variants of the spelling
          of the term separated by vertical bars (e.g., <code>data-lt="the
          term|the terms|terms"</code>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Also note that the <code>href</code>-less <code>a</code> element is
          not limited to linking to definitions but also knows how to link to
          other items such as WebIDL interfaces.
        </p>
        <p class="note" title="title attribute deprecated">
          In earlier versions of ReSpec, it was possible to use the
          <code>title</code> attribute to specify the link title for a
          definition or a reference to a definition. This is now
          <em>deprecated</em> and support for it will be removed in a future
          version of ReSpec. Please migrate to using the <code>data-lt</code>
          attribute. This is consistent with Bikeshed (another popular
          publication tool) and will allow the use of the <code>title</code>
          attribute for other, more appropriate things in the future.

        <h2>
          References
        </h2>
        <p>
          Specifications typically need to have references to other
          specifications on which they build to define their own technology.
          Managing references is a pain, as is linking to them every time that
          they are mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          ReSpec takes the pain out of this with multiple features that are
          used together. First, when you need to refer to a given specification
          in the body of the text, simply do so using
          <code>[[<span>FOO</span>]]</code> for informative references (those
          that are just intended to clarify the matter at hand) and
          <code>[[!<span>FOO</span>]]</code> for normative ones (those which
          are required for the implementation of the specification at hand).
          ReSpec will replace those with the link the reference and the
          appropriate markup around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, using all the collected references from the document, ReSpec
          will generate a “References” section with subsections for normative
          and informative references (when they appear). Inside the latter, it
          will place the relevant bibliographical data for those references,
          using the conventional markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          References are loaded from a shared database that is maintained by a
          group of volunteers. If you need a reference that is not in the
          database, then the right thing to do is to submit it for inclusion so
          that others can benefit from it too. However, if that is not possible
          then you can make use of the <a>localBiblio</a> configuration option.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish the “References” section to be prefaced with some text,
          you can set the <a>refNote</a> option to the content you wish to use,
          as in <a href=
          'examples/inlines.html?refNote=Some%20text%20inserted%20here'>this
          example</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only things you therefore need to know for references are the
          reference names of the specifications you wish to refer to (as well
          as to how to add your own to the database). The names are usually
          rather logical, and most of the time can be guessed. In other cases,
          you can go look for them in the central bibliographical database that
          is maintained at <a href='https://github.com/tobie/specref'>SpecRef
          database</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ever want to use <code>[[\TextInDoubleBrackets]]</code> that
          doesn't represent a reference, for example to represent an <a href=
          "http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots">
          ECMAScript internal slot</a>, write it as
          <code>[[<span>\InternalSlot</span>]]</code>.

        <h2>
          Best Practice Documents
        </h2>
        <p>
          Best practices may be shown, numbered, and formatted using a
          <code>div</code> with class <code><a>practice</a></code> containing a
          <code>p &gt; span.<a>practicelab</a></code> with the practice's title
          and a <code>p.<a>practicedesc</a></code> with description of the
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feature is rarely used, and likely needs to be updated. If you
          wish to use it in anger, please contact me and we can improve support
          for it.
        </p>
        <pre class='example'>
&lt;div class="practice"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span id="some-practice" class="practicelab"&gt;Title of the practice&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="practicedesc"&gt;
    More detailed description of the practice.          
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          If a <code>section</code> element with <code>id</code>
          "<code>bp-summary</code>" is present, then a summary list of best
          practices will be placed in it, linked to the best practices that
          have an id on the <code>span</code> element.
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
          &lt;section id='bp-summary'&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

      <h2>
        Creating a Static Snapshot
      </h2>
      <p>
        Of course the downside of the approach taken by ReSpec is that the
        specification as it is expected to be, with all its bells and whistles,
        exists only in your browser's memory as a DOM. Publishing directly with
        the script would not work as the source would not pass PubRules and
        would work poorly with search engines that do not process JS (also
        people generally frown upon reference documents that do not work
        without JavaScript). does not work for all browsers (and there are
        still quite a few people using Internet Explorer out there) and would
        not show all the content for search indexing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution that is used here is that you hit the
        <code>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S</code> key combination. Unless you know what you
        are doing, pick "Save as HTML (Source)". This will produce a dump of
        the generated source, which you can paste into the document you want to
        be your specification snapshot. The process is a little bit tedious,
        but normally you should only need to do it very rarely. You can hit
        <code>Esc</code> to hide the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a copy of the ReSpec repository handy, you may see that
        there is also a <code>respec2html.js</code> tool under
        <code>tools/</code>. Feel free to try using it instead of the above
        process, but please note that it is not used much currently and may
        behave in a somewhat experimental manner (experiences with it vary —
        but it's worth a shot if you're looking for a way to generate ReSpec
        output from the command line).
      </p>
      <p>
        ReSpec is also capable of producing a diff-marked version if you have a
        configuration setting of <a>previousDiffURI</a> set to a document to
        compare to (which defaults to <a>previousURI</a>). When you press that
        button, you will obtained a diffmarked version instead of a regular
        specification. By default, the diff tool is set to
        <code>http://www.aptest.com/standards/htmldiff/htmldiff.pl</code>, but
        you can override this by setting <a>diffTool</a>.

      <h2>
        WebIDL Support
      </h2>
      <p>
        This chapter is about WebIDL, the binding language for APIs. ReSpec has
        extensive WebIDL support, but naturally if you're not writing an API
        specification then you can definitely save yourself the trouble and
        skip this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        ReSpec allows you to write WebIDL into pre blocks. Simply :
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="WebIDL example">
      &lt;pre&gt;
      interface Foo(){
        readonly attribte bar;
        Promise toDoSomething(Thing withThing);
      };
      dictionary Things{
        color;
      };
      &lt;pre&gt;
      </pre>
      <p>
        See the <a href="examples/webidl-contiguous.html">Contiguous IDL
        document</a> for an introduction and exhaustive examples.
