  <h2>publishDate</h2>
  <p>
    A <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> date. The publication date of the present document. For documents that
    are in flux, such as Editor's Drafts or unofficial documents, this is best left unspecified as
    ReSpec will use the document's last modification date (as provided by the browser) in order to
    set this. For documents intended for official publication, this is normally required.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that the last modified date provided by the browser can at times be wrong. This often
    happens when the server is itself providing a broken value, or at times when differences in
    timezones (that are not always well accounted-for by servers or browsers) cause the day to
    shift by one.
